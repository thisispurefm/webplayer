# webplayer

A pure JavaScript radio webplayer for PureFM.  
  
Should be *slightly* responsive for displays of different shapes, but primarily intended to be used in a popup window from the main site.  
Includes such amazing features as:
- A volume slider
- LocalStorage for volume settings
- A pause button?
